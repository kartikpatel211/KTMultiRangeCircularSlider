This is a UI control through which user can create multiple ranges in a circular slider.
One can update values of each range using start ans atop handles.
Through delegates, get notify about changes into range.
One can add range by touch anywhere on circle and can remove any range.
This is very different control than traditional circular slider as user can add, remove, edit multiple ranges in it.
One can update handle icons, change colors and add gradient color in ranges. Also, add titles inside circle to indicate values.
This is totally customizable UIControl that user can user as per their need.

This includes UIControl class as well as ViewController as an example.

This control is made by using CircularSlider(Christopher Olsen caolsen) control. Many thanks to Christopher Olsen.
